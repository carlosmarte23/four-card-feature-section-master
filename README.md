## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

### What I learned

In this challenge I tried to use Sass with a more detailed structure, I used separated files for variables, components and mixins.

It was aso my first time using mixins, I used them for the cards with diferent colored top borders.

### Continued development

Ill try to use Sass more in the future, I think its a good way to organize the stylesheets and make it easier to mantain.
